# Syllabus

This course is all about the art and science of visualizing data.
Learn about the what (types of visualizations, tools to produce them), the how (start with a design, pre-process the data, map it to graphical attributes, make strategic decisions about visual encoding, post-process for readability and visual appeal), and the why (the theory behind the grammar of graphics).
Evaluate the clarity, effectiveness, and honesty of visualization choices and improve (your and others') visualizations through an iterative design process.
Discuss the role of statistical graphics in modeling and inference.
Do it all in R, reproducibly, and using a variety of modern data visualization packages.

## Behaviour and Health

### Behavior and Community Standards

All students must adhere to the [Duke Community Standard (DCS)](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/community-standard-student-conduct): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability.
Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.

To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

Students affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:

-   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
-   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;
-   I will act if the Standard is compromised

Regardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one's own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects.
Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard.
If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Jeanna McCullers ([jeanna.mccullers\@duke.edu](mailto:jeanna.mccullers@duke.edu){.email}), Director of the Office of Student Conduct.
