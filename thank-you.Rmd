# Thank you cards

Each of these thank you cards are made in R with ggplot2 by students in STA/ISS 313.
A huge thanks to all of our guest speakers!

```{r out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Thank you cards created with ggplot2."}
image_paths <- fs::dir_ls("images/thank-you", glob = ".md", invert = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(image_paths)
```
