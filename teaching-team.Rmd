<img src="images/vittorio.png" class="cover" width="240" height="240"/> [**Vittorio Orlandi**](https://vittorioorlandi.github.io/) (he/him) is a PhD student in Statistical Science.
Vittorio works on methods in causal inference and Bayesian nonparametrics that can be used in practice, that are designed to handle the complexity inherent in real data without making naive assumptions, and that have have exceptional predictive accuracy as well as other desirable features like interpretability and uncertainty quantification.

Vittorio's **office hours** are 2-3pm on Mondays and 11am-12pm on Tuesdays in person at Old Chem 203B.
